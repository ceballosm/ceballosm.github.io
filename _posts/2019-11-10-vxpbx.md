Description: Segmentation fault on program counter

Exploitability Classification: EXPLOITABLE
Explanation: The target tried to access data at an address that matches the program counter. This is likely due to the execution of a branch instruction (ex: 'call') with a bad argument, but it could also be due to execution continuing past the end of a memory region or another cause. Regardless this likely indicates that the program counter contents are tainted and can be controlled by an attacker.
